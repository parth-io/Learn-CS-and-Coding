# Learn CS and Coding

Just a summary detailing my CS and coding learning journey, replete with code fragments I have created.

My aim to serve the legions of interested wannabe-programmers, and help them use this page as a starting point.
My advice is, get started with Python first, then transition to OOP, then to C++ and C (then assembly language if you feel like it - and Perl for the whiz kids).
Practise coding and participate in online competitions and hackathons to gain some experience.
There are some amazing bootcamps out there, but programming is a largely meritocratic field and students can design their own curriculum at their own pace for free. (Resources I have gathered and tips for Java and Python will be posted here soon).
Get used to Linux, do not be daunted by the terminal. The terminal is the coolest and snappiest feature of Linux. Period.
Oh, and please support open-source!

BEGIN HISTORY>>>>>
So I got interested in coding, seeming to be a superpower of sorts. One hears about all these successful techpreneurs and gold-plated brands like Google, and one feels like joining their ranks. After all, it's always easier to join the winning side than to defend a losing side. 

My first foray was with Linux. After hating on Windows for years, and yearing for a smoother experience on an ageing laptop, I decided to take the plunge with Linux. I had some limited experience with Ubuntu when I was a kid, but I was mainly limited to the GUI aspect. Boy, was Linux fun. I had some fun customising my install of Xubuntu (I wanted a light and quick experience), but Xubuntu seemed a bit stale and dated to me. Frankly, it grew out on me after a few months of use. I tried out Linux Mint, Kubuntu, and Ubuntu Mate, but Kubuntu offered the best of the Linux world to me. (Yes, I am biased towards Debian, it is very beginner-friendly - but that being said, i am planning to try Arch Linux, Manjaro and Kali Linux next). I slowly learnt the ins-and-outs of the Linux world, and read endless articles recent and old that proclaimed the death of Windows and the rise of Linux (however, I received a shock when Microsoft did a U-turn recently and started to support open-source, with its most prominent show of support being the Windows Subsystem for Linux). Then came a fair bit of reading on DNS as I tried to setup my home VPN network on my server and router. The intricacies of networking, which were boring and frustuating, eluded me. It made me feel like wanting to redesign the whole networking system from scratch. A blissful period ensued, where I enjoyed some cool Linux programs (Xaos - Fractal Zoomer), puzzles (SGT Puzzles Collection), games (the Battle for Wesnoth and 0 A.D.).

Then began an exploration into Python and coding essentials via the book 'Head First: Learn to Code'. Fair warning, the book is way too easy for someone from a STEM background in high school, and it simplies explanations to the point of confusion - you are left scratching your head as to what the author meant at times, then feeling the light from a breaking dawn of realisation suffuse you. The book could do with some brevity, but for all that, it has some decent Python code that serves as an excellent primer to the Python coding style and language syntax. Oh - an interesting read is the Zen of Python (PEP 20).

Wanting a challenge, I then proceeded on to HackerRank. I solved a few HackerRank problems under the category of Problem Solving, got bored with Python, and transited to learning Java under '30 Days of Learning to Code'. Where I got smacked in the face by concepts such as devious concepts such as linked lists and data trees. Fascinating stuff, the '30 Days' course starts slow, but builds up quickly later. (It took me more than 30 days to master the basics of Java and OOP).

Parallely, I began studying Math under MIT's OpenCourseware Math for Computer Science (still completing). I also realised the need for a formal experience in learning Computer Science and not just programming, so I began Princeton's Programming with a Purpose course on Coursera (still completing).

Along the way, I picked up lots of useless technical articles, webpages, resources, guides and books. I will upload this whole compendium of resources on a progressive basis, starting with my coding samples.
